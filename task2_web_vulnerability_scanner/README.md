# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This project is a Python-based vulnerability scanner that detects basic SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.

The tool is designed for educational and demonstration purposes and should only be used on authorized or test environments.

---

## Vulnerabilities Tested

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
Occurs when user input is improperly handled in database queries, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL logic.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Occurs when user input is reflected in web pages without sanitization, allowing script execution in browsers.

---

## How It Works

- Accepts a target URL with query parameters
- Injects common SQLi payloads
- Checks responses for database error indicators
- Injects a basic XSS payload
- Detects reflected scripts in the response

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run the scanner
```bash
python3 scanner.py
```

### Step 2: Enter a valid test URL
Example:
```
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1
```

---

## Important Usage Notes
- The URL **must contain a parameter** (`?param=value`)
- Do NOT test real or unauthorized websites
- Recommended test site:
  ```
  http://testphp.vulnweb.com
  ```

## Corner Cases & Error Handling
- URLs without parameters are rejected
- Network issues are handled gracefully
- Invalid URLs will not crash the program
