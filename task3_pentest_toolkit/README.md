# Penetration Testing Toolkit

## Overview
This project is a modular Penetration Testing Toolkit developed as part of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship.

The toolkit demonstrates basic penetration testing concepts such as port scanning and brute-force attack simulation in a safe and educational manner.

---

## Modules Included

### 1. Port Scanner
Scans a predefined list of common ports on a target system using socket connections to identify open ports.

### 2. Brute Force Simulator
Simulates a brute-force login attempt using a predefined password list against dummy credentials.  
This module is implemented strictly for demonstration purposes.
