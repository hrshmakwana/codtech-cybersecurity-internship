# Penetration Testing Toolkit

## Overview
This project is a modular penetration testing toolkit that demonstrates basic security testing techniques.

It includes multiple modules implemented separately and accessed through a single menu-driven interface.

---

## Modules Included

### Port Scanner
Scans common ports on a target system using socket connections to identify open ports.

### Brute Force Simulator
Simulates brute-force login attempts using a predefined password list against dummy credentials.

This module is intentionally non-destructive and educational.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run the toolkit
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Step 2: Choose a module
```
1 → Port Scanner
2 → Brute Force Simulator
```

---

## Example Usage

### Port Scanner
- Enter a hostname (e.g. `scanme.nmap.org`)
- Open ports are displayed

### Brute Force Simulator
- Enter any username
- The tool tests predefined passwords
- Demonstrates brute-force logic

---

## Corner Cases & Notes
- The brute-force module is a simulation, not a real attack
- Network delays may affect port scan results
- Limited port range is used for safety

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- socket module

## Disclaimer
This toolkit is strictly for educational purposes and does not perform real-world attacks.
