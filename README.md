# CODTECH Cyber Security Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains all four tasks completed as part of the CODTECH Cyber Security Internship.
Each task focuses on a core cybersecurity concept and is implemented using Python with clear documentation and usage instructions.

The projects are designed to be educational, modular, and easy to use, demonstrating practical security fundamentals rather than advanced exploitation.
